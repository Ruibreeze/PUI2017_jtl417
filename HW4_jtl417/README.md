For assignment 1 I worked by myself to review Unisse's test set-up from last week's homework.

For assignment 2 I worked with Juan and Prince. Here is the table:

| **Statistical Analyses    |  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
|ANOVA    | Level achieved during the 2014/2015 season (Professional, Semiprofessional or Not-Professional) | ordinal |Player test results during the 2004 -2006 period (Players under 12). The tests included Sprint speed, Agility, Dribbling, Ball control and Shooting) | continuous | Players weight and height relative to age. (When they were 12) | continuous |     Is a player's success in soccer signifficantly explained by his skills in pre-adolescence | Professional players pre adolescent skills = Semiprofessional players pre adolescent skills = non-professional players pre adolescent skills | 0.05 | http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182211 |
  |Multiple Regression|Death Rate|Continuous|Body Shape Index (ABSI), Diabetes, Blood Pressure, Smoking, Serum Cholesterol, Sex, Age, Ethnicity|Continuous and binary variables|Body Mass Index (BMI) |Continuous|Is the Body Shape Index (ABSI) better for predicting premature death than the Body Mass Index (BMI)?|The difference between the actual amount of deaths and the prediction using ABSI = the difference between the amount of real deaths and those predicted using BMI |0.05|http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039504|
  |Logistic Regression|Critical level of scalar stress, where the presence of colony fissioning is considered expression of not critical vs. critical level| Binary, where (1 = above the level, 0 = below the level)|Community size (as number of members in the community)|Categorical (could be seen as continuous)|Not identified|Not identified|Does the population amount of a community signifficantly affects the probabilty of having higher levels of scalar stress?|for every population level Pi the probablity of having a Critical Stress Level is the same|0.05|http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091510|


For assignment 3 I talked a bit with Prince about how to do the chi-squared test.

For assignment 4 I worked with Prince, Christian, Sarah, Matt and Andrew. We shared ideas about filtering for daytime/night-time and for determining manhattan vs. brooklyn. We also discussed what the results of our tests meant.
