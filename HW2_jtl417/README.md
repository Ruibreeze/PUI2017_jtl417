For this assignment I had a variety of collaborators. For part 1, I worked with Charlie Moffett to figure out how to index the JSON. I helped Julian and Juan do this as well. I did Part 2 on my own and helped Julian and Juan with this part. I was in office hours with Juan for part 3 so we shared some ideas about indexing and slicing. I worked with Julian for the extra credit assignment.
