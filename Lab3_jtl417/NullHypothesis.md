**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

**Ho**: average %fat reduction in testing period for those on diet (P0) is the same or less than those exercising (P1)

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)**

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**P0**: Children of mothers who smoked when pregnant

**P1**: Children of mothers who did not smoke when pregnant

**H0**: average IQ of P0 is >= P1

**Food deserts Contribute to the incidence of diabetes**

Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

**P0**: US population further than 5 miles from a healthy food provider

**P1**: US population less than 5 miles from a healthy food provider

**H0**: Rate of diabetes for P0 <= rate of diabetes for P1
