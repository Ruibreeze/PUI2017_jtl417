# PUI2017_jtl417

##Workflow

There are two environments I set up my PUI workspace in: a github repository (which this is!) and a folder in my compute environment entitled PUI2017. I created the PUI2017 directory as well as an alias allowing me to easily change to that directory from the main computing stage. This involved the creating of a variable storing the directory address of PUI2017 and the creation of an alias linking to that directory. The images below show this in more detail. After this I created the repository in github, cloned it in my terminal and used that to create this readme!
